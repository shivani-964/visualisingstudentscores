## Student Score Analysis and Prediction Tool üéì

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help students analyze their current academic performance and predict the marks required to achieve a target SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average). The tool provides insights on component-wise marks for various subjects and generates a personalized PDF gradesheet.

## Features

**üìä Performance Analysis:**
        Input your current marks for different components of each subject (Midterms, EndSem, Others).
        Predict the marks required in upcoming exams to achieve a desired SGPA.
        
**‚úÖ Feasibility Check:**
        The tool determines if achieving the target SGPA is feasible based on the inputted current marks.
        
**üìà Visualizations:**

        Choose from multiple types of visualizations:
        
            **~ Histograms**
            
            **~ Line Graphs**
            
            **~ Scatter Plots**
            
            **~ Heatmaps**
            
            **~ Pie Charts**
            
        These visualizations give you a clear breakdown of your current and required marks.

**üìù PDF Gradesheet:**
        Generate a customized PDF gradesheet containing your current marks, required marks, and a breakdown for each subject.
        
**üó£ Faculty Comments:**
        A chatbot that offers subject-specific advice from faculty to help you improve your performance.

**üí™ Motivational Quotes:**
       Get random motivational quotes to keep you inspired throughout your academic journey.

**üìÖ Upcoming Exam Schedules:**
       A quick view of upcoming exams for your subjects, helping you stay prepared.

**Emotion Feedback:**
       Express how you feel about your component-wise marks, whether you‚Äôre happy, neutral, or unhappy.

## Usage

**1: Enter Your Marks:** Input your marks in each subject for different components (Midterms, EndSem, Others).

**2: Set Target SGPA:** Adjust the slider to set your target SGPA.

**3: Analyze Results:** View the required marks, check the feasibility, and visualize your performance.

**4: Download Gradesheet:** Generate and download a PDF gradesheet with the current and required marks.

## Visualizations

Histograms and heatmaps provide an overview of your scores.

Line graphs and scatter plots show how your scores are distributed across various components.

Pie charts give a breakdown of marks distribution per subject.
