## Student Score Analysis and Prediction Tool üéì

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help students analyze their current academic performance and predict the marks required to achieve a target SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average). The tool provides insights on component-wise marks for various subjects and generates a personalized PDF gradesheet.

## Features

**üìä Performance Analysis:**
        Input your current marks for different components of each subject (Midterms, EndSem, Others).
        Predict the marks required in upcoming exams to achieve a desired SGPA.
        
**‚úÖ Feasibility Check:**
        The tool determines if achieving the target SGPA is feasible based on the inputted current marks.
        
**üìà Visualizations:**

        Choose from multiple types of visualizations:

            **Histograms**
            
            **Line Graphs**
            
            **Scatter Plots**
            
            **Heatmaps**
            
            **Pie Charts**
